ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis & LSTM
Predicting stock market trends is a complex challenge influenced by numerous factors, including investor sentiment. This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast stock price movements based on the sentiment extracted from financial news headlines.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This deep learning pipeline:

Extracts sentiment from real-world financial headlines.

Correlates sentiment trends with historical stock price movements.

Predicts future stock direction using an RNN-LSTM model.

ðŸš€ Key Highlights
âœ… Sentiment-Driven LSTM Model

Trained an RNN-LSTM model to detect temporal patterns in sentiment-rich news data.

âœ… Advanced NLP Techniques

Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, lemmatization

Feature extraction: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe

Sentiment scoring: VADER, TextBlob, BERT-based models

âœ… Real-Time Financial Data Integration

Collected stock prices using Yahoo Finance API / Alpha Vantage

Scraped and cleaned news headlines from trusted financial sources (e.g., Reuters, Bloomberg)

âœ… Model Optimization

Applied dropout regularization, sequence padding

Tuned hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, sequence length)

âœ… Performance Evaluation

Regression Metrics: RMSE, MAE

Classification Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score

âœ… Visualization Tools

Used Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to visualize sentiment shifts and stock movements

âœ… Interactive Deployment

Built a user-friendly web app using Flask and Streamlit for live sentiment-based trend predictions
